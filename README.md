# `zsh-hist`
Edit your Zsh history, without ever leaving the command line.

* [Installation](#installation)
* Features:
  * Eliminate more duplicates by applying [uniform code formatting](#uniform-code-formatting).
  * (Optional) [Automatically expand aliases](#optional-automatic-alias-expansion) before each
    command line is saved to history.
  * Fix your previous command by [pressing <kbd>undo</kbd>](#added-undo-functionality).
  * Push & get lines to/from history with [<kbd>push-line</kbd> and
    <kbd>get-line</kbd>](#push--get-lines-tofrom-history).
  * Edit your history with the [`hist` command](#hist-command-syntax).
* Don't know how to change your key bindings? Please [read these notes](#note-about-key-bindings).

## Installation
 1. `git clone` this repo.
 1. Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file:
    ```zsh
    source path/to/zsh-hist.plugin.zsh
    ```

To update, `cd` into your clone and `git pull`.

## Uniform code formatting
Whenever you finish your command line, `zsh-hist` will automatically format it for you, before it
is saved to history. You can also retroactively format your history with
[`hist n`](#hist-command-syntax).
You can also disable automatic history format with:
```zsh
zstyle ':hist:*' disable-format-hook yes
```

**Notes:**
* For the formatting to be preserved completely when the command is saved history, you need to
  `unsetopt HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS` in your `.zshrc` file. Otherwise, most of the indentation will get
  lost.
* Formatting the code can disable certain crazy uses of global aliases. For example, since the
  formatting turns most `;`s into newlines, declaring `;` as a global alias will most of the time
  simply not have any effect. Since this is not something a normal person would want to do, most
  users don't need to worry about this. However, if you are a purist and want that the formatting
  can _never_ change the way Zsh works, then please enable the [automatic alias
  expansion](#optional-automatic-alias-expansion) feature below.

## (Optional) Automatic alias expansion
`zsh-hist` can automatically expand your aliases before each command line is saved to history.
This is disabled by default, but to enable it, add the following to your `.zshrc` file:
```zsh
zstyle ':hist:*' expand-aliases yes
```

## Added Undo functionality
On any new command line, you can now press <kbd>undo</kbd> to pop the last command from your
history into the line editor, letting you correct any mistakes you made, before running it back.
Afterwards, the old, faulty command will be gone from your history and only the new, corrected one
remains.

Additionally, if you make a typo and end up on the secondary prompt, you can now press
<kbd>undo</kbd> to return to the primary prompt.

## Push & Get lines to/from history
When you press <kbd>push-line</kbd>, <kbd>push-input</kbd> or <kbd>push-line-or-edit</kbd>, your
line is now written to history (without being executed) instead of to the buffer stack.

This has the following benefits:
* A pushed line does not automatically get popped back into your line editor. You can instead get
  it back at your own convenience with <kbd>get-line</kbd>, at which point it is removed from
  history. (Executing the line will of course add it back to your history, but at this point, it
  will not count as pushed anymore.)
* Pushed lines persist as long as they remain in your history and can be shared between multiple
  sessions.
* Pushed lines can be accessed using conventional history search mechanisms.

To get a list of all pushed lines in your history, just type `hist l`.

## `hist` command syntax
```
Usage
  hist [<option>...] compress <delta>
  hist [<option>...] {reload|undo}
  hist [<option>...] <command> [<selection> ...]

Return value
  $reply  an associative array of history (index -> entry) tuples

Options
  -f  force: never ask for confirmation
  -i  interactive: always ask for confirmation
  -q  quiet: do not print anything
  -s  silent: same as quiet
By default, hist asks for confirmation only when operating on multiple history
entries.

Commands (can be shortened to first letter):
  compress   delete each entry that differs <delta> chars or less from the next
  delete     remove from history
  edit       delete, then modify & append as new
  fix        delete + get
  get        load into buffer
  list       look, but do not touch
  normalize  delete, then auto-format & append as new
  reload     re-initialize local history from file
  undo       roll back to before last command in same session

Selections (for commands other than compress, reload or undo):
  no arg        pushed lines
  positive int  index from beginning of history
  negative int  offset from end of history
  pattern       all matching entries

Examples
  hist f -1         # Fix last entry (cut from history; paste into command line)
  hist n {1..9}     # Normalize (uniformly format) a range of history items
  hist d $'*(\n|;)' # Delete all entries ending in newline or semicolon
  hist l            # List all entries saved w/ `push-line` widget
```

## Note about key bindings
`zsh-hist` does not change your key bindings. To use the keyboard commands (a.k.a "widgets") that
`zsh-hist` enhances, you will need to know to which key strokes they are bound. Not all widgets
discussed here are bound by default.
* Type `bindkey` to see your current key bindings.
* To add a new new keybinding or override an existing one, add lines like the following to your
  `~/.zshrc` file, where `^` means <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and `^[` means <kbd>Alt</kbd> (depending on your
  terminal):
  ```sh
  bindkey "^_" undo
  bindkey "^[q" push-line-or-edit
  bindkey "^[g" get-line
  ```
* See the [Zsh Line Editor
  documentation](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html) for more info.
