# `zsh-hist`
* Fix your previous command by [pressing <kbd>Undo</kbd>](#added-undo-functionality).
* Edit your history with the [`hist` command](#command-line-syntax).

## Added Undo functionality
On any new command line, you can now press <kbd>Undo</kbd> to pop the last command from your
history into the line editor, letting you correct any mistakes you made before running it back.
Afterwards, the old command will no longer be found.

`zsh-hist` does not change keybindings. By default zsh binds `undo` to `^_`, `^Xu`, and `^X^U`
in emacs mode and to `u` in vi command mode. For a custom keybinding, add a line like
`bindkey 'YOUR_KEY_CODE' undo` to your `.zshrc`.

## Command line syntax
